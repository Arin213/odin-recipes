        <h2>Steps and Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step</b>
                <p>
                    Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and<br/> 
                    cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed.

            </li>
            <li><b>Step</b>
                <p>
                    Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges<br/>
                    with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to<br/> 
                    seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.

            </li>
            <li><b>Step</b>
                <p>
                    Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch<br/>
                    to prevent them from sticking together; steam until pork is cooked through,<br/> 
                    about 15 minutes.
